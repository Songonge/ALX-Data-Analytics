## Introduction
This week, my team and I decided on a single problem statement, conducted research, and provided evidence of its impact and trends (using data and visualizations).

## The Ideal Team Menber
An ideal team member:
* **Is Reliable**: A great team player is someone others can depend on. Show up on time, meet deadlines, and fulfill your commitments. Be the person your teammates know they can count on.

* **Communicates Effectively**: Communication is key! Listen attentively, express your ideas clearly, and be open to different perspectives. Create a positive and inclusive environment where everyone’s voice is valued.

* **Embraces Collaboration**: Working together is where the magic happens! Embrace collaboration by sharing responsibilities, supporting your peers, and actively participating in group activities. Remember, we’re stronger when we work as a team.

* **Displays Respect**: Treat your teammates with kindness, empathy, and respect. Value their opinions, celebrate their achievements, and offer constructive feedback. A respectful team environment fosters trust and boosts productivity.

* **Sets Personal Principles**: Reflect on the principles that guide you as an individual. What values do you hold dear? How can you incorporate these principles into your teamwork? Define your personal code of conduct and let it shine through in your interactions. (We will have time to do this in the next activity.)

* **Stretches Themself**: Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone and contribute in ways that showcase your unique strengths. Take on new responsibilities, offer innovative ideas, and support your peers in their growth. Stretching yourself leads to personal growth and remarkable contributions.

## Being an Outstanding Teammate
When employers are asked for the top skills they desire in their employees, the 4 most commonly listed are dependability, flexibility, problem-solving, and communication. These are all soft skills, and they are all skills that make people outstanding teammates. 

### Teammate Skill #1: Dependability
This one is pretty straightforward!
A dependable teammate:
*	Does what they say they are going to do
*	Meets deadlines
*	Shows up to all scheduled meetings and commitments
*	Is on time
*	Proactively communicates

### Teammate Skill #2: Flexibility
A flexible teammate:
*	Is positive when obstacles or difficulties arise
*	Can adjust quickly to new requirements or circumstances
*	Is resilient in the face of change
*	Practices grit and growth mindset to improve over time

### Teammate Skill #3: Problem-solving
Problem-solving requires using both creative thinking (also known as divergent thinking) and critical thinking (also known as convergent thinking) to come up with and test out solutions. It also often requires grit and perseverance. Throughout this course, we will continue to give you opportunities to practice solving problems!

### Teammate Skill #4: Communication
**Communication** is the act of sharing and receiving information. Talking, writing, listening, and reading are all forms of verbal communication.

**Nonverbal communication** includes tone of voice, gestures, eye movements, facial expressions, posture, and body language. Nonverbal communication can (intentionally or unintentionally) convey your feelings and can have a positive or negative impact on your message.
Communication is such a hugely important skill and a vast topic. It could easily be the subject of its own course. So we’d like to break it down just a little further for you, into areas of communication that are especially important for success in a team:
1. The 7 C’s
2. Listening
3. Consensus Building
4. Proactive Communication
5. Giving Feedback
6. Receiving Feedback

#### Communication: The 7 C's
An effective communicator speaks and writes clearly, conveys approachability in their body language, pays attention to what others are saying, and respects differing perspectives.
Effective communication is made up of several characteristics which we can call the 7 C’s.
As you watch this short video, make sure you can recognize and briefly explain each of the 7 C’s.
In short, the 7 Cs of communication are a set of guidelines that can help you to communicate more effectively in both written and spoken forms. They are:
1. Clear: Your message should be easy to understand and free of ambiguity. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your audience may not be familiar with.
2. Concise: Get to the point quickly and avoid unnecessary details. Your audience will appreciate your brevity.
3. Concrete: Use specific language and examples to support your ideas. Avoid vague or abstract statements.
4. Correct: Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. This will help to ensure that your message is taken seriously.
5. Coherent: Your message should flow logically from one point to the next. Avoid making sudden jumps or introducing irrelevant information.
6. Complete: Make sure that your message includes all of the necessary information. Don’t leave your audience guessing.
7. Courteous: Be respectful of your audience and their point of view. Avoid using offensive language or making personal attacks.

#### Proactive Communication
Proactive communication means communicating ideas, information, and updates in anticipation of someone’s needs. When you communicate proactively, you solve problems before they happen, respond to questions before they are even asked, and manage complaints before they become a problem.
Being proactive means taking charge of a situation or potential problem, rather than reacting to it after it has occurred. Proactiveness involves thinking ahead, anticipating needs, and addressing them. Good examples of proactive communication are:
*	Informing your teammates about your current progress on your action items (especially what you will deliver and when),
*	Telling a client what your priorities are, or
*	Telling your boss as soon as possible if you know you’ll need more time for a task.

#### Communication: Listening
Listening is a HUGE part of successful communication! Sometimes it can be hard to really listen, especially when we think we already know what a person is going to say, are frustrated with the person or situation, or are distracted, stressed or tired. Putting in a little extra effort to actively listen goes a LONG way. It’s worth it!
Here are a few tips you can practice that will help you become a better listener:
1. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking. (There are exceptions when someone constantly scrambles and goes on and on, but in general, try to practice patience.)
2. Pay attention. Do not look distracted - make eye contact and nod when appropriate!
3. Try to remember what is being said, and then restate it in simple terms. You can add “Did I get that right?” Restating and asking for confirmation is a practice called active listening, and it can be especially valuable when the conversation is complex and/or tense.

#### Communication: Building Consensus
Consensus is reaching an agreement. Creating consensus within a team means finding a proposed action acceptable enough so that all team members can support it, with no team member opposing it. Consensus happens when teammates do the following:
*	Share their opinions and ideas
*	Listen effectively to one another
*	Respectfully discuss the differences in their ideas and explore compromises
*	Are willing to not get everything they each want
*	Agree on an outcome that everyone can live with.

Consensus is NOT:
*	Having a unanimous vote
*	Majority rule
*	One-person rule
*	Haggling or bargaining

##### 4 Steps to Build Consensus in Your Team
* **Step 1: Understand Who Is Involved (AKA Your Stakeholders)**
You must understand the stakeholders involved in a decision-making process to find common ground. This will help ensure that all perspectives and points of view are considered. When you account for everybody’s concerns, requirements, and priorities, you encourage open communication and trust-building.
* **Step 2: Agree on What The Problem is**
You must start with a clear purpose and focus on the issues at hand. Once you align everybody’s common purpose and vision, it is then easier to identify the main problem.
* **Step 3: Brainstorm with Your Team!**
Brainstorming sessions encourage every team member to express ideas, as well as their concerns and perspectives. This helps build alignment and understanding amongst team members.
* **Step 4: Create Space for Feedback**
Create a physical or online space that feels safe for every team member to provide honest feedback. This will enhance the consensus-building process.

#### Communication: Giving Feedback
Being able to give effective, constructive feedback is another key skill that outstanding teammates have developed. Like any skill, we learn to get better at giving (and receiving) feedback over time.  

##### Tips for giving great feedback 
1. Ask a micro-yes question: Ask a question to make sure the person is ready to receive feedback. For example: “I have some feedback about how that went. Would you like to hear it? Is it a good time?” Or “Do you have 5 minutes for me to share some thoughts about what happened in our last meeting?”
2. Give data points and be specific and objective: Avoid ambiguous or vague statements like “You could be more proactive.” Instead try statements like, “You said you’d send out that email by 11 am and I still don’t have it.”
3. Show impact: Name exactly how the actions affected you. For example: “I have 3 clients that are threatening to go to our competitor because we haven’t delivered on time.” (You may also request a specific different action or behavior.)
4. End with a question. For example: “How does this land for you?” or “What was your experience of the situation?”

#### Communication: Receiving Feedback
Giving feedback to another person can often feel fairly easy. But what about receiving feedback? We often dread it because sometimes the message is something we don’t want to hear!

## Team Skills

### Conflict Management: Approaches
Conflict in a tech team can arise when team members have different opinions, ideas, perspectives, or approaches to solving problems. While conflict may seem negative, it can actually be beneficial if embraced and managed effectively. It can provide an opportunity for growth, innovation, understanding, and better decision-making. Conflicts are also unavoidable, particularly when people collaborate. So it’s a really valuable skill to know how to engage in them and healthily resolve them.

Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilmann identified 2 dimensions that form our approaches to conflict management: Assertiveness and Cooperativeness.

**Assertiveness** is the degree to which people are willing to take initiative and force their will upon others. Being assertive can be especially useful in the following scenarios:
*	You need a result ASAP.
*	There are ethical or moral issues needed to be addressed.
*	You know you are right and need to push forward.
*	Other styles of attempting to resolve a conflict have been ineffective.
*	Your power and authority are significant.

**Cooperativeness** is the degree of willingness to work together to accomplish a goal. It is especially useful in the following scenarios:
*	There is no clear-cut solution to the issue at hand.
*	Your way may not be 100% the right way.
*	Your teammates are cooperative and there is not much disagreement.
*	You want to minimize potentially hostile interactions with your teammates.
*	You are willing to give up ground in order to find a resolution.

### Conflict Management: Methods
This is the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Model (continued)
To resolve conflict, you will typically apply both Assertiveness and Cooperativeness to some degree. How much of each will depend on you, your required outcome, and the scenario you are facing. 

When the 2 approaches – Assertiveness and Cooperativeness – are combined in different ways, we end up with 5 main methods of conflict resolution. These are:
*	Avoiding: Low assertiveness and low cooperativeness 
*	Competing: High assertiveness and low cooperativeness 
*	Accommodating: Low assertiveness and high cooperativeness 
*	Collaborating: High assertiveness and high cooperativeness 
*	Compromising: A medium amount of both approaches
