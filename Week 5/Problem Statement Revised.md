## Introduction
This a team project involving five members. We are tasked to propose solutions to our chosen GCGO.

**Chosen GCGO**: Women Empowerment

**Problem**: There is the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles.

## Reflection
Reflecting on the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, here are three aspects that could be tackled:
### Mentorship and Sponsorship Programs
Establishing or enhancing mentorship and sponsorship programs for women can provide guidance, support, and advocacy. These programs can help women navigate their career paths, overcome challenges, and gain visibility in leadership roles.

### Bias and Inclusion Training
Implementing bias and inclusion training for all levels of an organization can raise awareness of unconscious biases that may hinder women's advancement. This training can foster a more inclusive culture where women's contributions are recognized and valued.

### Flexible Work Policies
Promoting and expanding flexible work policies, such as remote work and flexible hours, can support work-life balance. This is particularly important for women who often bear a disproportionate share of caregiving responsibilities, allowing them to pursue leadership opportunities without sacrificing personal obligations.

### Leadership Development Programs
Creating targeted leadership development programs for women can equip them with the skills, confidence, and networks needed to advance into leadership roles. These programs can include workshops, coaching, and leadership opportunities that prepare women for higher responsibilities.

### Equitable Recruitment and Promotion Practices
Reviewing and refining recruitment and promotion practices to ensure they are equitable can help increase the number of women in leadership roles. This includes setting clear criteria for advancement, ensuring diverse hiring panels, and actively seeking out qualified female candidates for leadership positions.

Among the aspects above highlighted, our most intriguing aspect is “Mentoring and Sponsoring Programs”.

## Our reasoning
Mentorship and sponsorship programs are critical in addressing the barriers that women face in advancing to leadership roles. Mentorship provides women with guidance, advice, and support from experienced leaders who can help them navigate career challenges, build confidence, and develop essential leadership skills. Through these relationships, women can gain insights into the unwritten rules of leadership, receive constructive feedback, and expand their professional networks.

Sponsorship goes a step further by actively advocating for women's advancement. Sponsors not only provide mentorship but also use their influence to create opportunities for women to be considered for leadership roles. They can champion women's achievements, recommend them for high-visibility projects, and support their candidacy for promotions.

By focusing on mentorship and sponsorship, organizations can directly address the lack of representation by ensuring that women have the resources, support, and advocacy needed to rise to leadership positions. This approach helps to level the playing field, making leadership opportunities more accessible and achievable for women.

## The McKinsey Problem Statement Framework
Using the McKinsey Problem Statement Framework, my team and I will outline the different elements of our example problem and formulate a problem statement

### What is the problem?
The underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, which is partly due to the lack of effective mentorship and sponsorship programs that can help women advance in their careers.

### Where and when does the problem occur? 
The problem occurs across various tech industries and organizations in Cameroon, particularly in environments where women are underrepresented in senior leadership positions. It happens during critical career advancement stages when women need support and advocacy to move into leadership roles.

###  Who is affected?
Women professionals, particularly those aspiring to leadership roles. The entire organization is also impacted, as the lack of diverse leadership limits innovation, decision-making quality, and overall performance.

### What will make a solution successful?
A solution will be successful if it involves designing and implementing structured mentorship and sponsorship programs tailored to women’s needs. Success factors include:
*	Access to high-quality mentors and sponsors who are committed to women’s career development.
*	Organizational support and commitment to diversity and inclusion.
*	Regular evaluation and adaptation of the programs to ensure they meet women’s needs and lead to measurable outcomes in terms of increased representation in leadership.

### What are the boundaries of this problem?
The boundaries of this problem include organizational culture, existing leadership pipelines, and the availability of resources (e.g., time, budget) to implement and sustain effective mentorship and sponsorship programs. Additionally, societal norms and biases that influence workplace dynamics also play a role.

### Who or what can stop us from implementing the solution?
Potential obstacles include resistance from existing leadership, who may be unaware of or unconvinced about the benefits of mentorship and sponsorship programs focused on women. Limited resources or competing organizational priorities could also hinder the implementation. Additionally, unconscious biases and a lack of commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives could undermine the success of the programs.

## Problem Statement
The underrepresentation of women in leadership roles within our organization is a significant issue, largely due to the lack of effective mentorship and sponsorship programs that can support women’s career advancement. To address this, we need to implement structured programs that provide women with the necessary guidance, advocacy, and professional development opportunities. These programs must be supported by strong organizational commitment and tailored to overcome the unique challenges women face in their career progression.
