# Problem Impact Assessment

**Problem**: Underrepresentation of women in leadership roles.

## Groups Primarily Impacted
The primary groups impacted by the underrepresentation of women in leadership are women themselves in various groups, sectors, and geographic locations, especially those aspiring to or currently in professional careers, their families, and society at large. Within the group of women, those in male-dominated fields such as STEM, politics, and senior corporate roles face particularly pronounced challenges. Additionally, organizations and businesses are also significantly impacted, as they miss out on the benefits of diverse leadership.

## Effects on Each Group
   * **Women**: Women face limited opportunities for career advancement and leadership roles, leading to reduced economic stability and professional growth. They often encounter wage disparities, fewer mentorship opportunities, and greater career interruptions due to family responsibilities. These obstacles hinder their ability to attain leadership positions and influence decision-making processes. For example, women in politics face obstacles in candidacy and election processes, often receiving less support and funding compared to their male counterparts.

   * **Families**: Families are affected by the professional struggles of women, as gender inequality in leadership can result in less economic security and stability. Women who are unable to achieve leadership roles may also face higher stress levels, which can affect family dynamics and overall well-being.

   * **Society**: Society as a whole suffers from a lack of diverse leadership. When women are underrepresented in decision-making positions, policies, and organizational strategies may lack inclusivity and fail to address the needs of the entire population. This can lead to less effective governance, reduced innovation, and slower economic growth.

   * **Organizations**: Businesses and organizations miss out on the diverse perspectives and skills that women bring to leadership roles. This can lead to a lack of innovation, poorer financial performance, and a workplace culture that does not fully support diversity and inclusion. Studies have shown that companies with diverse leadership teams tend to perform better financially and have higher employee satisfaction and retention rates.

## Manifestation in Everyday Lives
In their everyday lives, women aspiring to leadership roles often experience discrimination and bias in hiring, promotion, and compensation. They may have to work harder than their male counterparts to prove their capabilities, often facing microaggressions and skepticism about their leadership abilities. Balancing work and family responsibilities can also be more challenging for women, particularly in the absence of supportive policies such as paid family leave and affordable childcare. As for families, the impact manifests as financial stress and the need to navigate societal expectations regarding gender roles. Women in families may find themselves taking on a disproportionate share of domestic responsibilities, which can limit their ability to pursue career advancement opportunities. As far as society is concerned, it feels the impact of less inclusive policies and a slower rate of social progress. The lack of diverse leadership means that important perspectives and ideas are not considered in decision-making processes, leading to less effective and equitable outcomes for the community as a whole.

## Changes in Quality of Life or Outcomes
The underrepresentation of women in leadership roles negatively affects their quality of life and outcomes by limiting their economic and professional opportunities. Women who face career stagnation due to gender biases and lack of support may experience lower job satisfaction, higher stress levels, and reduced overall well-being. Financial insecurity resulting from wage gaps and limited career advancement can also affect their quality of life, limiting access to resources such as healthcare, education, and housing. Talking about families, this can translate into financial instability and reduced economic mobility. Children in such families may also suffer from the stress and time constraints faced by their parents, potentially impacting their educational and developmental outcomes. At the societal level, the overall quality of life can be diminished by less effective governance, slower economic growth, and reduced social cohesion. Inequities in leadership contribute to a cycle of poverty and inequality, as diverse perspectives necessary for addressing complex social issues are often overlooked. Organizations that fail to achieve gender diversity in leadership roles may see poorer financial performance and lower employee morale, leading to higher turnover rates and reduced competitiveness in the market.
