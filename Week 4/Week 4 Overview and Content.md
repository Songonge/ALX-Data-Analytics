## Writing Foundations

### Why We Share Stories
Storytelling is a powerful tool that plays an essential role in the workplace. Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to better understand and connect with new ideas and concepts. Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.

Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a positive and productive work environment. By incorporating storytelling into their communication strategies, organizations can better engage employees and clients, promote collaboration and creativity, and ultimately achieve greater success.

### Storytelling Rubric
When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.
 
| Characteristic  |	Description  |
| :------------- | :------------- | 
| **AUDIENCE RELEVANCE**: The speaker can use their understanding of a specific audience to decide what content is most relevant to and effective for them.	| Content addresses a specific audience and successfully provides relevant and effective information for the specific audience. |
| **LANGUAGE**: The speaker has a solid understanding of language usage that they apply to create authentic content that has an appropriate register (vocabulary, voice, tone, sentence structure, and terminology), clarity, and accurate, varied language. |	The language is inviting and effective, with high accuracy in grammar, vocabulary, and a variety of sentence structures; register and style are effective and appropriate for the task. |
| **VOICE**: The speaker can create a consistent and engaging voice that is appropriate to the medium they are using. | 	The text is free of clichés, generalizations, or technical jargon. The story sounds fresh and different (offers a different perspective).|
| **NARRATIVES**: The speaker understands the qualities of effective storytelling and uses them to create powerful narratives that engage an audience and inspire action. |	The story provides vivid scenes that center around a relatable protagonist. It also contains all the elements of effective narrative storytelling (characters, dialogue, engages the audience, and avoids the inverted pyramid). The story is written mostly in real-time, has a balance of detail and summary, and is free of the “Most Common Storytelling Mistakes.”| 
|**STRUCTURING**: The speaker can structure a story effectively to create maximum impact on an audience. | 	The story of self has a clear purpose/problem identified in the beginning and is rooted in personal experiences. The story has a clear and engaging call to action.|

## The Writing Process
Storytelling takes place in various forms. Writing is one of the most commonly used forms of communication in the workplace and it is extremely beneficial to understand the simple steps you can take to create relevant and compelling stories.

Writing is a process, and it takes time and effort to create something great. When writing in the workspace, there are considerations you should make to get your message across.

### Steps to Professional Writing
#### Step 1: Understanding the Audience
Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs.
#### Step 2: Defining the Purpose
Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.
#### Step 3: Research Background Information
To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. If you are preparing a business report or presentation including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.
#### Step 4: Planning and Organizing
Before you start writing, it’s important to plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to help you organize your thoughts and structure your writing. This will help you stay organized and focused, and make your writing more coherent and easier to follow.
#### Step 5: Stick to One Topic
Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.
#### Step 6: Writing Clearly and Concisely
When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.
#### Step 7: Proofreading and Editing
After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.
#### Step 8: Following Professional Writing Etiquette
In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.
By understanding your audience, defining your purpose, planning and organizing your ideas, writing clearly and concisely, proofreading and editing your work, and following professional writing etiquette, you can create professional writing that is clear, concise, and effective.
