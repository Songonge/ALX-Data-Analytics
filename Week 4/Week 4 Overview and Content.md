## Writing Foundations

### Why We Share Stories
Storytelling is a powerful tool that plays an essential role in the workplace. Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to better understand and connect with new ideas and concepts. Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.

Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a positive and productive work environment. By incorporating storytelling into their communication strategies, organizations can better engage employees and clients, promote collaboration and creativity, and ultimately achieve greater success.

### Storytelling Rubric
When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.
 
| Characteristic  |	Description  |
| :------------- | :------------- | 
| **AUDIENCE RELEVANCE**: The speaker can use their understanding of a specific audience to decide what content is most relevant to and effective for them.	| Content addresses a specific audience and successfully provides relevant and effective information for the specific audience. |
| **LANGUAGE**: The speaker has a solid understanding of language usage that they apply to create authentic content that has an appropriate register (vocabulary, voice, tone, sentence structure, and terminology), clarity, and accurate, varied language. |	The language is inviting and effective, with high accuracy in grammar, vocabulary, and a variety of sentence structures; register and style are effective and appropriate for the task. |
| **VOICE**: The speaker can create a consistent and engaging voice that is appropriate to the medium they are using. | 	The text is free of clichés, generalizations, or technical jargon. The story sounds fresh and different (offers a different perspective).|
| **NARRATIVES**: The speaker understands the qualities of effective storytelling and uses them to create powerful narratives that engage an audience and inspire action. |	The story provides vivid scenes that center around a relatable protagonist. It also contains all the elements of effective narrative storytelling (characters, dialogue, engages the audience, and avoids the inverted pyramid). The story is written mostly in real-time, has a balance of detail and summary, and is free of the “Most Common Storytelling Mistakes.”| 
|**STRUCTURING**: The speaker can structure a story effectively to create maximum impact on an audience. | 	The story of self has a clear purpose/problem identified in the beginning and is rooted in personal experiences. The story has a clear and engaging call to action.|

## The Writing Process
Storytelling takes place in various forms. Writing is one of the most commonly used forms of communication in the workplace and it is extremely beneficial to understand the simple steps you can take to create relevant and compelling stories.

Writing is a process, and it takes time and effort to create something great. When writing in the workspace, there are considerations you should make to get your message across.

### Steps to Professional Writing
#### Step 1: Understanding the Audience
Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs.
#### Step 2: Defining the Purpose
Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.
#### Step 3: Research Background Information
To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. If you are preparing a business report or presentation including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.
#### Step 4: Planning and Organizing
Before you start writing, it’s important to plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to help you organize your thoughts and structure your writing. This will help you stay organized and focused, and make your writing more coherent and easier to follow.
#### Step 5: Stick to One Topic
Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.
#### Step 6: Writing Clearly and Concisely
When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.
#### Step 7: Proofreading and Editing
After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.
#### Step 8: Following Professional Writing Etiquette
In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.
By understanding your audience, defining your purpose, planning and organizing your ideas, writing clearly and concisely, proofreading and editing your work, and following professional writing etiquette, you can create professional writing that is clear, concise, and effective.

### Creating a Storytelling Outline
To create a powerful story arc, it is essential to emphasize Step 3 of the writing process: organizing and planning. An effective tool that we can utilize for this purpose is called an outline.

You may already be familiar with outlines from your previous English classes back in high school. Outlines serve as excellent aids for listing the main parts of your story, ensuring a key message in each section, and connecting all the elements in a compelling narrative or structure.

#### Outline Worksheet
An outline can have the following five simple steps:
1	Tease your idea through a creative story or a similar approach.
2	Tell them what you will talk about (preview).
3	Walk through each topic.
4	Review what you talked about.
5	Include a call to action.

### Writing Best Practices
When you are writing to communicate information, your writing must meet these 7 key elements. They’re also called the “7 C’s of Communication”.
*	**Clear** - main ideas are easy to identify and understand.
*	**Concise** - to the point without using unneeded words or images.
*	**Concrete** - includes specific examples or explanations.
*	**Correct** - in information, word choice, and grammar.
*	**Coherent** - information presented in a logical sequence.
*	**Complete** - provides enough information so the audience can understand.
*	**Courteous** - polite and professional.

## Communicating a Story
“A powerful story can change the world.” - Anonymous

With a single story, we can…
*	Inspire individuals to join our cause
*	Encourage donors to fund our projects
*	Illustrate our organization’s impact
*	…and many more!

### Formulating a story
There are several steps in crafting powerful stories
* **Step 1: Identify a protagonist** (that one stakeholder that you want to talk about)
What is the archetype of a typical person (stakeholder) that is impacted most by this problem? Where do they live? What do they do? Do you know someone who fits this profile? Give your protagonist a name and a character profile.
* **Step 2: Get into the protagonist’s shoes**
What does your protagonist do daily? What’s the first thing they do when they wake up? Where do they go and what activities are they likely to complete? How does the problem show up in their everyday life and inconvenience them? How does it make their lives more difficult/challenging than it already is?
* **Step 3: Describe their situation in vivid detail**
In this step, it’s important to write, as vividly and concretely as possible, how the protagonist encounters the problem in their everyday life. What are they doing when it shows up? How do they feel? What do they try to do to solve it, and what happens? Be as detailed as possible!
* **Step 4: Think about how things can change**
Imagine what would be possible if certain factors or situations changed. What if an intervention could successfully alleviate this problem in your protagonist’s life? How would they feel? How could their life be better? What could change about their situation?

### Stakeholder vs Audience
Our audience is Who are we telling our story to? The stakeholders and our audience are distinct entities. Stakeholders are those directly impacted by the problem you’re addressing, while the audience refers to the individuals you are sharing your story with.
1. Stakeholders: These are the individuals or groups directly affected by the problem. When considering the impact on stakeholders, think about their experiences, challenges, and needs related to the issue. Understanding their perspective will help you create a more impactful and relevant story.
2. Audience: Your audience is the group of people you are presenting your story to. They may include stakeholders, as well as others who may not have direct involvement but have an interest in the topic. Tailor your story to resonate with the audience’s interests, values, and motivations. Consider how the story can engage, educate, or inspire them to take action or change their perspective.

### Understanding our Audience
To improve on your story, it is also important to think about the audience that will be hearing it. To do so, you can ask yourself the following questions about your audience:
1. Role: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
2. Triggers: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
3. Needs: What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
4. Communication Style: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
5. Value to You: What do you want from this individual/group and how would that change the way you position the story?

## Goal Setting
A **goal** is a distinct or defined outcome that is expected from the assignment or project.

### S.M.A.R.T. Goals
Before we can get into how to build and set goals for ourselves, it’s important to first look at what goals are. In short, goals must be smart, and follow the acronym SMART!

A clear benefit of Knowing 1) what your goals are for the next few months/years, 2) what needs to be done to achieve the goals and 3) having a game plan in place, will help you identify activities and tasks that are worthy of your time now. In other words, it helps with time management and prioritizing the right tasks.

**S.M.A.R.T.** is an acronym, that gives criteria to guide how to set goals and objectives to yield better results. It means that your goal is **specific**, **measurable**, **attainable**, **relevant**, and **time-based**.
* **Specific**: An effective goal should be ultra-specific and leave no room for misinterpretation or vagueness.1
* **Measurable**: Your goal should be quantifiable and the progress easy to track, so you know when you hit a benchmark or the finish line.
* **Achievable**: Where the rubber meets the road. Is your personal goal attainable? You must be realistic and determine if your specific goal is truly achievable, or an unrealistic ask.
* **Relevant**: Big picture time. Does the goal you’re setting contribute to your bigger overarching goals? Ensure you’re setting goals that contribute to what you want in life.
* **Time-based**: SMART objective goals should have defined start and end times, and, if large enough, should also have incremental dates to meet specific objectives.

S.M.A.R.T. goals give both the goal-setter and the person assessing their progress a clear road map to follow. The person setting the goal (e.g. the employee) gains a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished, and the person evaluating can then assess the outcome based on the defined criteria.

## Project Scope
Project scope is a crucial component of project planning as it involves determining a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs, and deadlines. In the project management process, project scoping typically comes before work planning, so let’s talk about that next. The project scope:
*	outlines the project’s boundaries to help the project owner/team remain focused on the task at hand and procedures for how completed work will be verified and approved.
*	describes the project’s purpose, what is included and isn’t, and important processes, assumptions, and limits.
*	is sometimes referred to as a statement of work (SOW), or terms of reference (ToR).

An effective project scope statement will include the following elements:
*	**Project justification** - you should have this from your problem statement and questioning exercises
*	**Product scope** - what is meant to be covered in the project
*	**Acceptance criteria** - how to check that it’s going well
*	**Deliverables** - exact milestones to be achieved
*	**Exclusions** - what is NOT involved in the project
*	**Constraints** - blockers to success
*	**Assumptions** - what you assume is true
