## Scenario
One day, as you are hanging out with friends at a nearby restaurant you get frustrated when the bill comes and you have to sit there for 20 minutes while your other friend calculates how much each person must pay, for the meal and waiter’s tip. Being the progressive techie that you are, an idea pops into your head:

You have decided to build a payment app that makes splitting the restaurant bill easier. 

## Problem Statement
Splitting a restaurant bill among friends can be a frustrating and time-consuming process, often leading to confusion, delays, and dissatisfaction. The lack of a simple, efficient method to divide the cost of a meal, including the tip, among a group of people results in unnecessary stress and wasted time. There is a need for a user-friendly payment app that streamlines the process of splitting the bill, ensuring fairness and efficiency.

## Effective Questions
*	Who is the target audience for the app?
*	What platforms should the app be available on (iOS, Android, web)?
*	What are the key features that should be included in the app?
*	How will the app calculate each person’s share of the bill? 
*	How will the app handle varying payment methods (cash, credit card, mobile payments)?
*	Will the app allow users to split the bill unevenly based on what each person ordered?
* What user interface design will make the app most intuitive for users? 
*	How can we ensure that the app’s design is accessible to people with disabilities?
*	What security measures need to be implemented to protect users' financial information?
*	How will the app integrate with existing payment systems?
*	How will the app be monetized? 
*	What competitive advantages will this app have over existing bill-splitting solutions?
*	How will the app handle situations where someone forgets to pay or cancels their payment?
*	Will the app provide users with a history of their payments and splits?

## Assumptions 
•	Users are comfortable using mobile apps for financial transactions.
•	The target audience is tech-savvy and prefers digital solutions over manual calculations.
•	All users will have access to smartphones with internet connectivity.
•	The app will be used primarily in social dining settings where the bill needs to be split among multiple people.
•	The app will need to be compatible with various currencies and tipping customs.

## Revised Problem Statement
In social dining settings, splitting the restaurant bill among friends can lead to confusion, delays, and frustration, particularly when different payment methods and uneven contributions are involved. The process is often inefficient, causing unnecessary stress. To address this issue, we need to develop a user-friendly payment app that simplifies and automates the bill-splitting process. This app will calculate each person’s share, accommodate various payment methods, and handle different tipping customs, ensuring a fair and uniform experience for all users.
