## Step 1 
Rewrite your mission statement from Milestone # 2

I want to own a consulting firm and have several branches to satisfy many people. I plan to have openings for graduate students within my company where I will give chance to students to develop their skills and build their careers. I want to change lives, make a difference, and be an example for my children and those in my community. Lastly, I want to grow old with my family and live a happy fulfilled life.

## Step 2 
Imagine the person who can fulfill this mission! Fill out the details of this ultimate person in the space below. Write at least 3 items for each element.

| Element  | Your Description of the Person |

## Step 3
Conduct a Force Field Analysis of where you are and where you need to be to achieve your mission. Identify at least 4 items for each category. 

### Resources Available 
Reflect on yourself and your situation to determine which of the items you’ve mentioned in step 2 are already there with you. These don’t have to be complete and can be partially available, e.g. you may not have all the skills of being a great programmer, but you may have some basic stuff figured out. List these resources out in detail below.

Considering where I am now and where I need to be to achieve my mission, I can say the following regarding resources available:
*	Limited financial resources and minimal professional network.
*	Strong academic knowledge but limited practical experience in business management, leadership, and entrepreneurship.
* I have ambition, a strong desire to learn, and a sense of determination.
*	I have a foundational set of skills from your education, such as technical knowledge in my field of study, and problem-solving abilities.

### Barriers
Reflect on the list you’ve created for step 2, and identify the barriers that you need to overcome to become the person who can fulfill the mission you’ve set for yourself. These can be any specific degrees that you need to acquire, funding that you need to find, specific skills or attributes that you are yet to develop, etc. List these barriers out in detail below. 

*	Limited business experience
*	Financial constraints
*	Lack of a strong professional network
*	Competition in the consulting industry
*	Risk of burnout
*	Lack of guidance and mentorship 

## Step 4
Use the Force Field Analysis to determine your goals, starting from the long term, and then moving towards the short term. You need to make sure that these goals are SMART. At each stage, you can think of how to get to the next stage to create your goal, e.g if your 20-year goal is to create a business, then you need to have business knowhow for that, so your 10-year goal should be to either have an MBA or 7+ years of experience in that business field. Identify at least 2 goals for each stage mentioned in the table below. 

### 20-Year Goals
These are goals you want to have achieved 20 years from now that will help you achieve your mission statement. 

1. 20 years from now, I will own and successfully manage a consulting firm with at least five branches, providing career development opportunities for 100+ graduate students, and achieving a consistent annual growth rate of 10% across all branches.

2. 20 years from now, I will become a recognized leader in the consulting industry, with my firm being featured in at least three major industry publications and recognized with five industry awards for excellence in service and innovation.

### 10-Year Goals
These are goals that you want to have achieved 10 years from now that will help you achieve your 20-year goals.

1. 10 years from now, I will establish three successful branches of my consulting firm and provide mentorship and career development opportunities to at least 50 graduate students.

2. 10 years from now, I will develop and implement a robust corporate social responsibility (CSR) program that positively impacts 1,000+ community members and is integrated across all three branches of your consulting firm.

### 5-Year Goals
These are goals you want to have achieved 5 years from now that will help you achieve your 10-year goals.

1. 5 years from now, I will launch the first branch of my consulting firm, achieve profitability within two years, and mentor 10 graduate students through internships or other developmental programs.

2. 5 years from now, I will complete an advanced certification in business management or entrepreneurship, and apply the knowledge gained to develop a comprehensive business plan for my consulting firm’s first branch.

### 1-Year Goals
These are goals you want to have achieved 1 year from now that will help you achieve your 5-year goals. These will have to be much more specific, measurable, and realistic than any of your later stages. 

1. One year from now, I will gain practical business management experience by working in a consulting or related industry, expand my professional network by connecting with 50+ industry professionals, and secure mentorship from at least two experienced business leaders.

2. One year from now, I will attend at least four industry conferences or workshops to enhance my knowledge of the consulting field and identify three potential mentors or partners for my future consulting firm.
