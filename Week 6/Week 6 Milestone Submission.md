## SECTION A: User Interview Preparation 

### Step 1: Restate your team’s problem statement
The underrepresentation of women in leadership roles within our organization is a significant issue, largely due to the lack of effective mentorship and sponsorship programs that can support women’s career advancement. Women professionals, particularly those aspiring to leadership roles. The entire organization in any country is also impacted, as the lack of diverse leadership limits innovation, decision-making quality, and overall performance. 

To address this, we need to implement structured programs through an app that provides women with the necessary guidance, advocacy, and professional development opportunities. These programs must be supported by strong organizational commitment and tailored to overcome the unique challenges women face in their career progression. 

By addressing this issue, organizations can directly address the lack of representation by ensuring that women have the resources, support, and advocacy needed to rise to leadership positions. This approach will level the playing field, making leadership opportunities more accessible and achievable for women.

## SECTION D: Product Planning

### Step 1: Product Description
*	The ideal solution will be a website. It will look like a roadmap that directs the users to the steps to be taken and each task will have a subtask that must be completed to move to the next stage. Include an intro video to tell users how to navigate the website.
*	Users will create a profile that will give them access to the platform. An AI tool will be available to answer users' questions. There will be a dashboard to direct users to each feature of the platform. Users will need the internet to have access to the website.
*	The feature will have a roadmap, and a professional development course, getting each candidate that successfully completed the initial phase to a mentor that will direct them to the next step.

### Step 2: Product Solution
*	The website will be designed for women only because they are the minority in leadership roles and need guidance and mentorship opportunities to strive in that regard.
*	These features will help them develop themselves personally and professionally so that they can be ready to embrace challenges and take up leadership roles.
* The product will create awareness and provide the services and skills that young women need to be better prepared for leadership roles.
