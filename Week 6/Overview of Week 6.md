## Introduction
This week, my team and I revisit and build upon some previous weeks content, and acquire new skills that we can apply to advance our team project. It is a week for building skills that will set each of us apart and serve us in the workplace for years to come. 

## Human-Centered Design
**Human-centered Design** is described as a way of solving problems where deep empathy and understanding of people are at the center of the process of finding and developing the solution. This approach has been in existence since the early 1990s and was made popular by the company IDEO and the Stanford University d.school.

## B.U.I.L.D. Framework
The African Leadership Academy (ALA) modified the Human-centered Design approach to come up with the B.U.I.L.D. Framework.

B.U.I.L.D stands for:
*	**Believe**: Know that the problem you have identified has a solution, and trust that you and your team can build something to address it
*	**Understand**: Take the time to learn about the experience of the people affected by this problem / who will be using your solution – what does their journey look like? What are their pain points? What factors are affecting how they operate in / engage with the world?
*	**Invent**: Create a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to test out an idea that you have! Be sure to keep in mind how your “invention” will meet your users’ needs.
*	**Listen**: Get feedback from your users on your MVP / prototype and modify it as needed.
*	**Deliver**: Continue to deliver refined versions of your MVP / prototype and improve it over time!

## Design Thinking
Underlying both the Human Centered Design and the B.U.I.L.D concepts is a methodology called **Design Thinking**. Design Thinking provides a way to solve complex problems by understanding human needs, reframing the issue in a human-centric way, generating multiple ideas through brainstorming and creative thinking, and testing out ideas through prototyping and innovation.

The 5 stages of Design Thinking are:
1.	Empathize
2.	Define
3.	Ideate
4.	Prototype
5.	Test
> [!NOTE]
> The Design Thinking process is non-linear and iterative, meaning that while there are 5 stages, they do not necessarily have to be done in order, and each step can be revisited at any point in the process.

## Getting to Know Your User
Concerning the “U” step of the B.U.I.L.D framework and the key principles of Human Centered Design, it is important to take time to understand your users. Getting to know the User is crucial in developing a successful product or service and it will give you insights into:
*	**Who the users are**: Who are they? Who are they not?
*	**User needs**: Users have specific needs, and understanding those needs can help you develop a product or service that meets those needs.
*	**User experience**: A user-friendly product or service that meets the user’s needs will result in a positive user experience. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
*	**Competitive advantage**: Understanding the user can give you a competitive advantage by developing a product or service that meets the user’s needs better than other available options.
*	**Innovation Opportunities**: By understanding the user’s needs, you can identify areas for innovation and develop new products or services that meet those needs.

### Creating an Empathy Map
An **empathy map** is a visual tool that shows a user’s responses during an interview. It helps designers understand their users' needs, thoughts, and feelings. It is typically used during the user research and ideation stages of a design process to create a shared understanding of the user’s experience and to inform the design process.

An empathy map typically consists of four quadrants that represent different aspects of the user’s experience: what the user says, does, thinks, and feels. The quadrants are further divided into sub-sections that help identify specific aspects of the user’s experience, such as their motivations, pain points, and goals.
