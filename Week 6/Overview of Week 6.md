## Introduction
This week, my team and I revisit and build upon some previous weeks' content, and acquire new skills that we can apply to advance our team project. It is a week for building skills that will set each of us apart and serve us in the workplace for years to come. 

## Understanding the User

### Human-Centered Design
**Human-centered Design** is described as a way of solving problems where deep empathy and understanding of people are at the center of the process of finding and developing the solution. This approach has been in existence since the early 1990s and was made popular by the company IDEO and the Stanford University d.school.

### B.U.I.L.D. Framework
The African Leadership Academy (ALA) modified the Human-centered Design approach to come up with the B.U.I.L.D. Framework.

B.U.I.L.D stands for:
*	**Believe**: Know that the problem you have identified has a solution, and trust that you and your team can build something to address it
*	**Understand**: Take the time to learn about the experience of the people affected by this problem / who will be using your solution – what does their journey look like? What are their pain points? What factors are affecting how they operate in / engage with the world?
*	**Invent**: Create a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to test out an idea that you have! Be sure to keep in mind how your “invention” will meet your users’ needs.
*	**Listen**: Get feedback from your users on your MVP / prototype and modify it as needed.
*	**Deliver**: Continue to deliver refined versions of your MVP / prototype and improve it over time!

### Design Thinking
Underlying both the Human Centered Design and the B.U.I.L.D concepts is a methodology called **Design Thinking**. Design Thinking provides a way to solve complex problems by understanding human needs, reframing the issue in a human-centric way, generating multiple ideas through brainstorming and creative thinking, and testing out ideas through prototyping and innovation.

The 5 stages of Design Thinking are:
1.	Empathize
2.	Define
3.	Ideate
4.	Prototype
5.	Test
> [!NOTE]
> The Design Thinking process is non-linear and iterative, meaning that while there are 5 stages, they do not necessarily have to be done in order, and each step can be revisited at any point in the process.

## Getting to Know Your User
Concerning the “U” step of the B.U.I.L.D framework and the key principles of Human Centered Design, it is important to take time to understand your users. Getting to know the User is crucial in developing a successful product or service and it will give you insights into:
*	**Who the users are**: Who are they? Who are they not?
*	**User needs**: Users have specific needs, and understanding those needs can help you develop a product or service that meets those needs.
*	**User experience**: A user-friendly product or service that meets the user’s needs will result in a positive user experience. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
*	**Competitive advantage**: Understanding the user can give you a competitive advantage by developing a product or service that meets the user’s needs better than other available options.
*	**Innovation Opportunities**: By understanding the user’s needs, you can identify areas for innovation and develop new products or services that meet those needs.

### Creating an Empathy Map
An **empathy map** is a visual tool that shows a user’s responses during an interview. It helps designers understand their users' needs, thoughts, and feelings. It is typically used during the user research and ideation stages of a design process to create a shared understanding of the user’s experience and to inform the design process.

An empathy map typically consists of four quadrants that represent different aspects of the user’s experience: what the user says, does, thinks, and feels. The quadrants are further divided into sub-sections that help identify specific aspects of the user’s experience, such as their motivations, pain points, and goals. The following figure shows an [empathy map](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.FoZELdtU-kb48rsBn2iC5QAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using an empathy map gives designers a deeper understanding of their users’ needs, behaviors, and emotions. This information can then be used to inform design decisions and create solutions that meet the needs and expectations of the user.

### Drawing Insights
A logical step to get insights from my data would be to:
* **Step 1**: Analyze the information in front of you and look for patterns, contradictions, and opportunities for innovation. For example, if several users mentioned a specific pain point, this could be a potential opportunity for improvement.
* **Step 2**: Group similar insights together to create clear themes. This will help you identify the most significant user needs and priorities.
* **Step 3**: Prioritize the insights based on their importance to the user and their potential impact on the designed product or service.
* **Step 4**: Use the insights to inform your design decisions. Make sure to focus on the user’s perspective and avoid assumptions.

### Defining User vs Customer
In problem-solving, market research, and design thinking the User is different from the Customer.

A **User** is any individual who uses a particular product or service, regardless of whether they pay for it or not. For example, someone who uses a free social media platform would still be considered a user. In design thinking, a user refers to someone who interacts with a product or service, regardless of whether they pay for it or not. The focus is on understanding their needs, wants, behaviors, and pain points to create a better user experience. The goal is to create a solution that meets the user’s needs and helps them achieve their goals.

A **Customer**, on the other hand, is someone who pays for a product or service. They are usually purchasing something from a business, and the transaction involves an exchange of money. In design thinking, the focus is to understand their buying behaviors, motivations, and preferences to create a product or service that meets their needs and solves their problems. The goal is to create a solution that generates revenue for the business and creates value for the customer.

## Team Activity: Defining Target User
This team activity forms part of this week's Milestone submission.
Here, we need to refer back to the problem that our team chose to work on (Recall: the problem is "the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles"). Based on the problem that we identified, define our users by thinking through the following questions. These questions are used to define the user persona that we are solving the problem for.

1. **Who Experiences the Problem Directly?**  
User: Who directly encounters or is affected by the problem statement?
Customer: Whose awareness of the problem may come from reports or observations?

2. **Whose Pain Points Are Addressed by Solving the Problem?**  
User: Whose specific challenges or frustrations will be alleviated by solving the problem?
Customer: Whose strategic goals or concerns align with the resolution of this problem?

3. **Direct vs. Indirect Impact**  
User: Whose daily life, tasks, or experiences are directly impacted by the existence of the problem?
Customer: Whose decision-making or operational efficiency is indirectly influenced by the problem?

4. **Feedback on the Problem**  
User: Whose insights and observations are crucial for understanding the nuances of the problem?
Customer: Whose understanding of the problem may be shaped by reports, data, or external observations?

5. **Long-Term Consequences of the Problem**    
User: Whose quality of life or work is continuously affected by the persistence of the problem?
Customer: Whose strategic objectives or performance metrics are influenced by the ongoing existence of the problem?

> [!NOTE]
> The answer to the above questions will be your target user persona, which is also part of your Milestone # 6 submission in Section A, Step 2. Define this persona as a team, as this will affect who you will be interviewing this week (activity in the next module).

## Preparing for User Interviews

### Choosing Interviewees
Below is a special step-by-step guide on how to choose the right interviews.
1. **Create a user persona**
A user persona is a made-up individual who symbolizes our ideal user. By investigating the characteristics, objectives, motives, and pain points of our target users, we may develop a thorough user persona. This will assist us in establishing a list of requirements for choosing interviews.

2. **Recruit participants**
Once our research objectives have been established and a user persona has been developed, we may begin recruiting participants. There are many ways to find participants, including word-of-mouth, email, and social media.

3. **Screen participants**
Once possible participants have been found, we must screen them to make sure they meet the requirements for our user persona. A screening questionnaire can be used to learn more about a person’s demographics, product usage, and behavior. To determine their fit, we can also do a quick phone or video interview.

4. **Schedule interviews**
Following the screening process, we can set up interviews with the participants. Make sure we provide participants with detailed directions on how to join the interview and what to anticipate. To make scheduling simpler, think about utilizing a program like Calendly. 

### Types of User Interview Questions
Rule of thumb: A good interview generally allows deep, free-flowing conversations with the person you are interviewing
