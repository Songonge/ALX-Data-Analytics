## Introduction
This week is all about applying the creativity and innovation that I learned and heard so much about last week (week 6). Together with my amazing team, we will work towards the common goal we set up last week, and create the wireframes. 

## Creating Wireframes & Prototypes
Our goal as a team is to create a feasible representation of our product, gather feedback, and iterate on it to make improvements. It does not have to be perfect, but it should be as close to the real idea as possible within our means.

### Prototype 
A prototype is an early version of a product or design used to test and improve its features before the final version is made. It helps gather feedback, identify issues, and refine the concept before production.  
Imagine a prototype as a sneak peek or a preview of something exciting you’re creating! It’s like a rough draft or a mock-up that lets you test out your ideas and see how they work in practice. Think of it as a “pretend” version of your creation.  
A prototype can be constructed from any material, as long as it represents an idea or concept as simply as possible. A basic prototype should take a matter of hours to design and less than a day to build. It should represent the bare minimum needed to visualize an idea and bring it to life.

#### Why Is Prototyping Important?
We almost never get things right the first time! That’s why we need a prototype to test our concept. When we are building a product or solution for people, they are not quite as predictable as, say brick walls. A basic prototype should take a matter of hours to design and less than a day to build. It should represent the bare minimum needed to visualize an idea and bring it to life.

#### Steps you will be following to make a 3D prototype
1. **Define your product vision**  
   * Determine who your target customer or user is. (You should have done this in the previous module and by now your team should have already decided on a user persona).
   * Clearly envision what your product will be.
   * Identify the device or object you’re creating.
     
2. **Create a sketch (Individual preparation for the team meeting)**  
   * Once you have a good understanding of the product that you want to build, you need to create a visual.
   * Use pen and paper or computer-aided design (CAD) tools like Miro or Figma to create your visuals. You have the leeway to explore.
   * Draw a visual representation of your product idea so your team can see it clearly before you start to build. The sketch does not have to be perfect. It just needs to be something that helps you share your idea. Remember, a picture says 1000 words.
     
3. **Make a 3D prototype**  
   * Start with a simple version that shows the core functionality of your product
   * Use low-cost materials that you have on hand or are inexpensive.
   * Be creative and try different materials and construction methods.
   * Your prototype doesn’t need to be perfect, but it should be enough to show that your idea is feasible. It does not need to use any electronics.
   * It should be as close to the real idea as you can realistically get. For some teams, the prototype could work. For others, it may just be a model.
     
4. **Test the prototype**  
   * Use the insights from our user interviews to see what the prototype needs to look like, and what functions it should have.
   * Test and Identify areas that could be improved based on our use of the prototype as well.
   * Ideally, if there is time, conduct user interviews again, and have our users test the prototype to see how they respond to our product.
   * Show the prototype for users to check, see, and give us feedback on improvements we can make.
     
5. **Iterate on the prototype**  
   * Make changes to your prototype based on the feedback you received from your further user interviews. If you don’t conduct more interview, you can always check things yourself to see how you can make improvements.
   * Continuously refine and improve the prototype to make it closer to your final idea.

#### Prototyping Material
1. **Cardboard**: Cardboard is readily available, low-cost, and easy to work with. It can be used for creating structural elements, surfaces, and even simple mechanisms.
2. **Recycled materials**: Encourage students to repurpose materials that they already have, such as paper, plastic bottles, or packaging materials. These can be transformed into various prototype components.
3. **Foam and foam board**: Foam sheets or foam boards can be easily cut, shaped, and assembled to create prototypes. They are lightweight, affordable, and can be found in craft stores.
4. **3D printing with eco-friendly filaments**: If 3D printing is accessible, students can use eco-friendly filaments made from biodegradable materials.
5. **Natural materials**: Students can explore using materials found in nature, such as wood, bamboo, or natural fibers. These can be used for creating eco-friendly prototypes with a more organic feel.

### Wireframe
A wireframe is a visual representation or blueprint that outlines the basic structure, layout, and user interface elements of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app.
It is a simplified and low-fidelity representation that focuses on the arrangement and placement of key elements, such as content blocks, buttons, menus, and images. Wireframes typically omit detailed design elements like colors, typography, and imagery, and instead prioritize the overall layout and user flow.
They serve as a visual guide for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the structure and functionality of a digital product before moving on to the detailed design phase.

#### Steps for Creating Wireframes
1. **Define your product vision**  
Determine who your target customer or user is. (_This was done in the previous module and by now my team has already decided on a user persona_).  
Clearly envision what your product will be and identify the device or object you’re creating to make to meet your users’ needs.

2. **Sketch the screens or pages (As an individual and as a team)**
The first version of our wireframes is created using pencil and paper. Think about the main features, user goals, and actions that our app will provide. For example, suppose we were building an app where people could buy environmentally friendly products.
In that case, we might sketch screens for browsing products, adding items to a cart, checking out, and viewing order history.  
Or if we were creating a website where people could become part of a virtual community to protect endangered species, we could sketch the welcome page, a page for signing up, a page for making donations, a page showcasing user conversations, etc.

3. **Define the Navigation**  
The next step is to define the navigation of our app or website. How will users move from one screen to another? What are the common paths and scenarios that they will follow? We use arrows, labels, or symbols to indicate the transitions and interactions between
screens. For example, we might use a menu icon to show that users can access a sidebar with different options, or a back button to show that users can return to the previous screen.

5. **Add the elements**  
Once we have the screens and navigation of your app, we can add the elements that will make up the user interface. These include buttons, icons, text fields, images, sliders, and so on. We can use shapes, colors, fonts, and styles to represent these elements but keep
them simple and consistent. Remember, the purpose of a wireframe is not to design the style/aesthetics of our app, but to focus on functionality and usability.

6. **Annotate the wireframes**  
The final step is to annotate our wireframes with notes, comments, or instructions that explain the logic, behavior, or purpose of each element. This will help us communicate our ideas to other stakeholders, such as developers, clients, or testers. We use numbers,
letters, or symbols to link the elements with the annotations. For example, we might use a 1 to indicate that a button will trigger a pop-up window, and then write a note describing what the window will contain.

7. Digitize your sketches
Once we are happy with what we have created and our team has reached an agreement on functionality, we can create a digital version of everything we just sketched out using a tool such as Keynote, Miro, or Figma.

8. Review for Readiness
Check over everything that we have created to make sure that our wireframes are ready to show to our users. Is everything readable and clear? Will we be able to easily explain to our users what their experience would be like using our app or website? If so, we are
good to go!

### Prioritizing Your Prototype Features
So we have so many feature ideas for your prototype and you don’t know if you can do it all? Let’s try using the MoSCow prioritization method to fix this.
 
The MoSCoW method stands for:  
*	Must have
*	Should have
*	Could have
*	Will not have

## Preparing to Pitch
To improve on our story, it is also important to think about the audience that will be hearing it. To do so, we can ask ourselves the following questions about our audience.  
1. **Role**: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
2. **Triggers**: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
3. **Needs**: What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
4. **Communication Style**: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
5. **Value to us**: What do you want from this individual/group and how would that change the way you position the story?

### Pitching to Tech Leadership
At times, we are going to pitch to business leadership in a company, and at other times, we might need to advocate for your idea among senior tech leaders. These leaders might include roles such as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Product Officer, Engineering 
Manager, and Director of Product.

### Considerations to Make Before Pitching to Technology Leadership
1. **Understand your audience**: Research and gather information about the individuals we will be presenting to, such as their backgrounds, interests, and areas of expertise. Tailor our pitch to align with their goals and challenges, ensuring that our proposal
addresses their specific needs.

2. **Clearly highlight the problem and solution**: Begin by illustrating the current challenges and their impact on the organization. Then, introduce our solution as a means to address these pain points and demonstrate its potential benefits.

3. **Highlight the value proposition**: Tech leaders are often focused on the bottom line and ROI (Return on Investment). Emphasize the value proposition of our proposal by clearly outlining the tangible benefits it offers. Whether it is cost savings, increased
revenue, improved efficiency, or enhanced customer experience, tie our solution to specific metrics that resonate with tech leadership.

4. **Demonstrate expertise and credibility**: Establish our expertise and credibility by providing evidence of research done to show instances where your idea has helped other teams improve. Share relevant success stories, case studies, or testimonials to demonstrate
that this is the right idea to solve a particular problem.

5. **Anticipate questions and objections**: During your pitch, anticipate questions or objections that tech leadership might have. Prepare solid answers that address potential concerns and show that you have thoroughly considered all angles. Be open to feedback and
demonstrate our willingness to collaborate and adapt our proposal based on their input.  

## Key Career Skills 

### Imposter Syndrome
Do you feel like you are an imposter despite all of your achievements?  
Do you feel like you are never good enough? That you are where you are thanks to sheer luck, not necessarily your talent?  
Well, that’s the Imposter Syndrome! In this 12-minute TED talk video, Lisa and Richard describe what Imposter Syndrome means. Imposter Syndrome is when people have trouble internalizing their accomplishments and are in constant fear of being exposed as a fraud.

### How to Deal with Imposter Syndrome
Here are 4 slightly more elaborate research-backed (and Harvard Business Review-backed) steps to tackle imposter syndrome. Combatting imposter syndrome takes practice and time - go easy on yourself!

* **Step #1: Positive Reinforcement**  
Try keeping a “monthly wins tracker” to acknowledge your achievements and track your progress. You can kick imposter syndrome in its head by reflecting on and reminding yourself of your strengths frequently!
 
* **Step #2: Celebrate!**  
Too often than not, we focus so much on the outcomes of our work that we forget to recognize our efforts and work spirit. But celebrating ourselves for our attempts to achieve something (regardless of the end result) is a fantastic way to combat our imposter syndrome!

* **Step #3: Use Social Media Mindfully**  
Unfollow people on social media who make you feel like you are not good enough, or whom you continuously compare yourself with. Instead, follow educational and inspirational content that builds you up. This content should remind you to express gratitude for your achievements and allow yourself to visualize a future you want to achieve.

* **Step #4: Make a Plan**  
Come up with a step-by-step plan to manage your anxiety/ imposter syndrome. Break down your goals into smaller, more manageable chunks, and plan to tackle them one at a time! 

### More Suggestions on How to Deal with Imposter Syndrome
Here are 7 simple strategies that have been shown to be effective for coping with imposter syndrome.  
1. **Acknowledge and Normalize**: Recognize that feeling like an imposter is a common experience and that many individuals go through it. Understanding that it’s a normal phenomenon can help reduce the feeling that it only happens to you.
2. **Talk About It**: Open up to someone you trust, such as a peer, friend, family member, mentor, or counsellor, about your imposter feelings. Sharing your thoughts and emotions can provide relief and help you gain perspective.
3. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having negative thoughts or self-doubts, challenge them by asking for evidence to support or refute them. Look for counterexamples of your accomplishments and successes.
4. **Focus on Effort and Growth**: Shift your focus from the outcome to the effort you put into your work and the progress you make. Embrace a growth mindset, understanding that improvement comes with dedication and practice.
5. **Accept Imperfection**: Recognize that no one is perfect, and it’s normal to make mistakes. Allow yourself to learn from failures and view them as opportunities for growth (and NOT evidence that you are a failure!)
6. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and compassion. Be as supportive and understanding of yourself as you would be to a friend facing similar challenges.
7. **Engage in Self-Care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Practice the Daily 3! Get enough sleep, eat well-balanced meals, engage in activities you enjoy, and make time for relaxation and hobbies.
