## Problem Definition
A problem is an unwanted situation that must be addressed or resolved to achieve the desired situation.

Problems are a part of everyday life! Whether it’s something smaller like not having a phone charger when you’re in the middle of nowhere, or more significant problems like poverty and climate change, it is crucial to learn how to solve them and make decisions as efficiently and effectively as possible.

### 5 Whys Technique
To define a problem, you can use Lean’s “5 Times Why” method to find the root cause of the problem. In simple terms, you just keep asking “why” and after 5 times you will come to the root cause of the issue. Asking “Why” will save you from mislabeling a symptom of a problem as the root cause.

### 5 Ws (+H) Technique
The 5 Ws (+H) Technique is also a helpful approach to better understand, define, and articulate a problem: What, Who, Where, When, Why, (and How).
* What is the problem? What is reality like because of this problem? What will the reality be like if the problem continues?
* Who does this problem impact, directly and indirectly? (This could include people and/or animals.) Who contributes to the problem(for example, specific corporations, governments, and/or individuals)?
* When did the problem begin? When does the problem occur? When does it need to be resolved?
* Where is this problem occurring? (And what is the context in which it occurs?)
* Why is the problem happening? Why is it important to solve the problem? (highlight the pain)

## What is a problem statement?
A **problem statement** is a **concise and clear** description of a specific problem that needs to be solved, its significance, and who it affects. It identifies the gap between the current state (i.e., the problem) and the desired state (i.e., the goal).
A well-written problem statement helps to establish a clear understanding of the problem, which is the groundwork needed for developing effective solutions. Moreover, an effective problem statement is designed to address the Five Ws (+H).

### Key elements of an effective problem statement
* Create a succinct **problem description** (a more concise ‘what’ and possibly ‘when’)
* Indicate the specific **population** affected (a more concise ‘who’ and ‘where’)
* Explain the **impact** of the problem (cost, time, quality, environmental, personal, etc.). (a more concise ‘why’)
* Identify the **gap** that exists between present reality and the desired outcome. How would reality look if the problem were solved? (a more precise ‘how’)

### Content of a Problem Statement
Key elements of a problem statement are Problem Description, Population (location), Impact, and Gap between the current reality and the solved state.

## Problem Solving Approaches
Many frameworks and approaches have been developed over the years to help us better solve problems. We want to equip you with crucial problem-solving skills, particularly for your journey in tech, and will share with you two common problem-solving models that we find helpful:
1. The McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
2. Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework
These two frameworks are approaches to problem-solving and decision-making. While they share some similarities, they differ in focus and application.

### Cool Head, Warm Heart
The Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework is a problem-solving approach that balances analytical and emotional considerations. It involves making decisions that align with one’s values and goals while also considering the perspectives and feelings of others. This framework is often used in interpersonal and social contexts, such as leadership, communication, and conflict resolution.
This concept emphasizes the importance of balancing rationality and empathy in decision-making.

The Cool Head, Warm Heart framework has six elements to consider (See the table below)
|       |    COOL HEAD  | 	WARM HEART  |
|   :-------  |  :-------  |  :-------  |
| Frame	| Useful	|	Meaningful|
|Altematlves |	Dlstlnct, doable	|	Creative, Interesting|
|Information	| Reliable, relevant	|	Exploratory, moving |
|Values	| Preferences, metrics, tradeoffs	|	Intrinsic purpose |
|Integratlon	| Compelling logic / reasoning	|	Insplnng narrative, community |
|Commltment to action	| Action  plans	|	Leadership, followership |

### McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
The second problem-solving approach we will explore and practice is McKinsey’s Problem Solving Framework. This framework is often used in business and consulting settings and is particularly effective for analyzing data and developing data-driven and evidence-based solutions. The framework requires that we answer the following 6 questions:
1. What is the problem?
2. Where and when does the problem occur?
3. Who is affected?
4. What will make a solution successful?
5. What are the boundaries of this problem?
6. Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?

### Guide to Using each of the two problem-solving frameworks
|framework	| Best to use when…  |
|   :-------  |  :-------  |
| McKinsey Problem Solving Framework	| <ul><li>The problem is extremely complex or multi-layered and needs to be broken down</li><li>There is a lot of background information/context that will affect the outcome of the problem & solution</li><li>The problem tends to be more business-oriented</li></ul> |
| Cool Head, Warm Heart  |   <ul><li>The problem will significantly affect an individual or group of people</li><li>There are ethical considerations involved</li><li>The problem is high-profile and requires a balanced perspective that takes into account both logic and emotion</li></ul> |

## Asking the Right Questions
Asking effective questions is an essential step in problem-solving. Below are some reasons why it is important.
1. Gain information: Effective questions help you gather specific and detailed information to help you make better decisions and solve problems.
2. Clarify understanding: It will help gain insights into a particular subject, clarify a misunderstanding, or challenge assumptions.
3. Foster critical thinking: Effective questions require critical thinking skills, which can help develop analytical skills and improve your decision-making abilities.
4. Build relationships: When thoughtful questions are asked you show interest and empathy, which can foster a deeper understanding and connection with the team members, clients, and users.
5. Solve problems: Effective questions will help you identify a problem’s root cause and find potential solutions.

### Types of Effective Questions
* **Convergent** questions to drive toward a specific range of answers. Use this when seeking to understand how/why things work.
* **Divergent** questions open up unlimited avenues for responses. Use it when seeking to find alternatives.
* **Evaluative** questions to encourage deep analysis to answer. Use it when seeking to extrapolate/ make connections to other facts, situations contexts (to understand the potential significance of a given idea/situation)
* **Provocative** questions are designed to evoke an emotional response that may lead to deeper reflection. Use it to engage/wake up the listener, to have them reflect more deeply on their answer/thinking process, to tackle a difficult problem, to get more creative/thoughtful answers
	
### How to Write a Research Question
A **research question** is the question around which you center your research. It should be:
* **clear**: it provides enough specifics that one’s audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.
* **focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be answered thoroughly in the space the writing task allows.
* **concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
* **complex**: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to the composition of an answer.
* **arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.

### Steps to developing a research question
1. Choose an interesting general topic. to know more
2. Do some preliminary research on your general topic
3. Consider your audience 
4. Start asking questions  
5. Evaluate your question 

## Web Research
Research is a powerful skill and practice that we can use to:
* Learn more about the scope and context of a topic area or issue.
* Evaluate different perspectives on an issue and form our own opinions on how to best solve/approach a situation or question.
* Gather evidence that supports our claims or recommendations.
* Ensure that we are fully prepared for any risks or challenges that may come our way.

### Research Methodology
Similar to defining a problem, planning your research requires a set of key steps that allow you to maximize your time and effort as much as possible. Below are some high-level steps to follow as you begin your research process:
1. Define your objectives, questions, and hypotheses. What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. Determine your end outputs. What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. Scope your main sources of information. Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. Begin gathering your required information. What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information. From all of the information, you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. Synthesize and communicate your key findings. What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately. Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

## Leadership and Followership
Leaders are people who influence others through inspiring ideas, motivation, clear goals, providing mentorship and guidance where needed, and setting a positive example. They are a critical part of a project’s success and growth. Many of us mistakenly understand “leadership” as the authority to wield power over “followers”. We couldn’t be more wrong!
A good leader has the following traits:
* **Honesty**: A strong team is built on mutual trust and high morale. It relies on its leaders for encouragement, direction, and inspiration. The leader needs to be honest in whatever they lead the team into and offer a transparent vision for the team.
* **Ability to Build Good Relationships**: A leader can build a better team when they have a positive working relationship with their followers. Friendliness, graciousness, and generosity are behaviors that make a leader respected and cared for by their team!
* **Appreciativeness**: Leaders must never forget to express gratitude to their team members! Appreciation helps the team feel motivated to get the job done and to build trust with each other.
* **Humble**: A good leader also regularly asks for the team’s input and feedback and knows that good ideas can come from anywhere and anyone.
 
A leader works for the goal of a successful project, and should also be willing to hand their role over to someone else if the situation calls for it. They should be willing to become a follower if that is what is needed for the project’s success.
Qualities of a good follower include:
* **Loyal**: A good follower is loyal to the team’s goals, leaders, and mission. (While still thinking critically, and standing up for what is right.)
* **Diligent**: A good follower is active and hard-working to execute a project’s vision and instructions. They are dedicated to the success of the project.
* **Humble**: A good follower is humble and able to receive feedback, take directions, and deliver on their responsibilities.
