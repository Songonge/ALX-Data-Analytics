# Week 3 Milestone Submission

## SECTION A: Problem Statement 


### Step 1: My GCGO 
Which Grand Challenge or Great Opportunity (GCGO)  do you want to play a part in addressing? 
* CGO: Empowerment of women

### Step 2: Description of my Problem
The description of my Problem using What/Who/When/Where/Why/How…. 
1. **What** is the problem? What is reality like because of this problem? What will the reality be like if the problem continues? 
   * There are fewer women in power than men and this creates inequality in the representation of women in leadership positions. 
2. **Who** does this problem impact, directly and indirectly? Who contributes to the problem? 
   * Women worldwide and many communities are impacted. 
3. **When** did this problem begin? When does it occur?  
   * This problem has always been there and sometimes women are viewed as lacking potential when it comes to some influential positions. 
4. **Where** is this problem occurring? What is the context in which it occurs? 
   * The problem occurs in every sector of activity and also in many organizations. 
5. **Why** is this a problem? What are the pain points or gaps? Why do you personally care about this problem? 
   * This is a problem because women are less represented in any sector of activity and at any power level than men. I personally care about this problem because women must be empowered to hold any position they have the ability and skills to. 
6. **How** would reality be different if this problem was solved? (This can be your opinion.) 
   * If this problem is solved, women will have equal chances as men to hold any position at any 
level. As a result, this will create equilibrium in the society.

### Step 3: Understanding and Quantifying my Problem 
7. What is the historical context for this problem? What happened in the past that contributes to the problem now? 
   * The historical context for the underrepresentation of women is rooted in a long history of patriarchal systems and gender discrimination. Because men have always held the majority of leadership positions in sectors such as business, politics, and academia, this has led to 
legal discrimination (Women were historically barred from voting, owning property, or holding office.), educational barriers (Women had limited access to education and career fields leading to leadership roles.), and traditional gender roles (Women were seen as to hold 
domestic roles only.).

8. What are the possible economic (money-related) reasons why this problem exists and continues? 
The possible economic reasons why the underrepresentation of women exists are: 
   * **Career Interruption**: Because of family responsibilities women do not have other choices than taking career breaks.
   * **Wage Gap**: Women earn less than men. As a result, this reduces economic power and leadership opportunities. 
   * **Investment Disparities**: Women entrepreneurs face challenges in securing funding for their ventures compared to men entrepreneurs.

9. What are the possible political reasons why this problem exists and continues? 
The possible political reasons why the underrepresentation of women exists and continues include but are not limited to: 
   * Lack of Female Representation: There are few role models and mentors for aspiring female leaders contributing to fewer women in power.
   * Policy Priorities: Gender equality policies may not be prioritized since there are fewer women in decision-making roles.
   * Gender Bias in Political Systems: Political systems have always favored men in candidate selection and support and often leave no room for women.

10. What cultural beliefs and/or social norms possibly contribute to this problem? 
Cultural beliefs and/or social norms that possibly contribute to the underrepresentation of women in power include: 
   * Network Exclusion: Women are often excluded from male-dominated professional networks which limit their opportunities for career growth and leadership.  
   * Bias and Stereotypes: Men are always viewed as natural leaders and women as caregivers, discouraging women from pursuing leadership roles. 

11. Who are the people potentially responsible (directly or indirectly) for creating and/or maintaining this problem?       
People potentially responsible (directly or indirectly) for creating and/or maintaining the underrepresentation of women are: 
   * Educators: Schools maintaining gender stereotypes or those that fail to support women in pursuing leadership roles. 
   * Society at Large: Individuals upholding traditional gender roles and biases. 
   * Policymakers: People who have the power and ability to enact or enforce gender equality laws but do nothing. 
   * Corporate Leaders: Business leaders who do not prioritize diversity and inclusion in their hiring process. 
   * Media: Underrepresenting women in leadership roles. 

12. Approximately how many people (and/or animals) are directly impacted by this problem? Explain. 
    * Hundreds of millions of women worldwide are directly impacted by the underrepresentation of women in power. Some of the sectors where this arises include politics, business, and academia. These women face limited opportunities for career advancement, leadership roles, and equal 
pay, directly affecting their economic stability and professional growth. 

13. Approximately how many people (and/or animals) are indirectly impacted by this problem? Explain. 
    * Billions of people, including families, communities, and societies at large, are indirectly impacted by the underrepresentation of women in power. For example, gender inequality in leadership roles affects economic growth, social justice, and 
overall societal development. Children and men also suffer from the lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making that can lead to more inclusive and effective policies. 
 
14. What other numerical data can you share that is relevant to your problem? What can you find out about its size and scope? What can be measured? (For example, the amount of trash produced in Nairobi each day, the number of people without access to 
clean water, etc.) 
    * According to ChatGPT, on average, women earn 16% less than men globally. This varies by country, with some countries showing larger gaps. Talking about leadership representation, as of 2021, women held 26% of parliamentary seats worldwide and 8% of Fortune 500 CEO 
positions. The economic impact is in such a way that closing the gender gap in the workforce could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. On the other hand, countries with higher female representation in politics often see more comprehensive policies on education, health, and 
social services. 

### Step 4: Description of my Solved State 
 
15. If the problem were addressed/solved, what would reality be like? 
According to ChatGPT, if the underrepresentation of women in power was solved, it would bring several positive outcomes: 
    * **Equal representation in leadership positions**: For example, women would hold 50% of parliamentary seats and ministerial positions as well as occupy 50% of CEO positions and board seats. 
    * **The wage inequality will be resolved**: Women will earn the same wage as men which will reduce the gender pay gap to 0%. Moreover, all countries will ensure equal pay for equal work for both genders. 
    * **Educational and Career Opportunities**: Women will represent 50% of graduates and STEM professionals. There will be equal participation of men and women in leadership and development programs and mentoring opportunities. 
    * **Policy and social impact**: Having equal representation of women in leadership roles as men will bring comprehensive policies supporting family leave, childcare, healthcare, and education, resulting in equal sharing responsibilities between men and women and a 
balanced work-life. 
    * **Measurable outcomes**: The global GDP will significantly increase because of the economic participation of women, adding an estimated $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. In addition, poverty rates will be reduced, contributing to one of the SDGs. Also, there will 
be improved health and well-being for women and families, decreasing maternal mortality rates and providing better access to healthcare. 

16. Are there other benefits that would come from your problem being solved? Name at least one.  
    * Solving the problem of underrepresentation of women in power will enhance decision-making and innovation. For example, with equal representation of women in leadership roles, decision making processes would benefit from a broader range of perspectives, leading to more 
innovative and effective solutions. Apart from that, companies with gender-diverse leadership teams will tend to perform better financially, demonstrating higher profitability and productivity. Last but not least, gender equality could contribute to more consistent and stable societies by 
reducing social tensions and fostering a sense of fairness and inclusion, leading to lower crime rates and improved community well-being. 

### Step 5: Clarification of my Problem Scope 
17. What is NOT in scope for your problem? 
    * The scope of the problem does not include individual personal career choices. It does not apply to non-leadership roles or other employment levels. It does not address the career advancement of men in leadership roles. Lastly, it does not talk about economic inequality beyond gender. 

### Step 6: Areas for Learning 
18. What else would you like to know or understand better? (It can be anything related to your problem.) List 5-10 things. 
    * I would like to better understand the root causes of gender bias and how historical events and cultural norms have spread gender bias over time. I would like to understand the psychological foundations of gender stereotypes and biases. I would like to analyze countries, companies, or 
organizations that have successfully achieved gender parity in leadership. I would like to understand what has been effective in promoting gender equality. I would like to understand studies on the economic benefits of gender equality in leadership, including GDP growth and 
organizational performance. I would like to understand the economic costs associated with maintaining gender inequality. I would like to identify structural barriers that prevent women from advancing to leadership positions and explore the challenges women face in balancing 
professional and personal responsibilities. I would like to understand how educational systems and curricula can be reformed to encourage more women to pursue leadership roles. I would like to know the impact of mentorship and sponsorship programs in supporting women’s career 
advancement. I would like to study how gender inequality in leadership varies across different industries and what specific challenges exist in each sector and identify best practices for promoting gender equality in various industries. 

### Step 7: Problem Statement 
19. My problem is statement  

The underrepresentation of women in leadership and power roles in a variety of fields, including politics, business, academia, and others, causes gender inequality and limits the potential for diverse, inclusive, and effective decision-making. Goryunova and Madsen (2024) talk about the current status of women in political and business leadership globally, highlighting progress and data on women in corporate boards, CEO roles, and senior management. They highlighted the importance of gender parity initiatives and the need for concrete action, with insights from global leaders, and emphasized that understanding women's leadership status could advance theory, overcome barriers, and develop more women leaders. Although there has been improvement in recent years, many obstacles still stand in the way of women obtaining leadership positions. These include pay gaps, career disruptions brought on by family obligations, and widespread gender biases and preconceptions. These obstacles have a detrimental effect on societal advancement, economic expansion, and organizational performance in addition to impeding women's career advancement and financial security (OpenAI, 2024). 

Historical legal discrimination, educational obstacles, and gender norms that have traditionally supported men in positions of power are the main causes of this issue. The problem is made worse by economic issues including the gender wage gap and the difficulties women entrepreneurs face in obtaining funding. Political systems frequently display gender prejudice, and cultural norms and beliefs perpetuate gender role stereotypes, which further contributes to the persistent underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. Despite the need for agility in response to rapid change, biases, power dynamics, and bureaucratic structures can hinder progress, but aligning leadership theories with transformational leadership styles may provide women leaders with an advantage (Chin, 2011). To add to this, Schuh et al. (2014) think that research on female underrepresentation in leadership helps expand formal knowledge and identifies measures for promoting gender equality, contributing to theory development and practical interventions on gender and power motivation.  

According to Chikwe et al. (2024), navigating the double bind and overcoming stereotypes are critical challenges for women leaders, who can thrive by developing assertiveness, building supportive networks, enhancing emotional intelligence, and leveraging diversity as a strength. The authors conclude that organizations must promote gender diversity, inclusive cultures, and leadership development programs to create equitable workplaces where all individuals can succeed, fostering environments where women leaders are empowered and respected.  

Addressing this problem is crucial to achieve gender equality, enhance decision-making processes, and foster a more inclusive and prosperous society. The anticipated results are equal pay for equal labor, an enabling climate that allows women to pursue and thrive in leadership roles without encountering disproportionate impediments, and a balanced representation of men and women in leadership positions.

      1. Aina (2022) discussed how gender inequalities hinder women from career advancements in the workplace. The author also proposed what women can do to promote themselves and achieve more success in the workplace. 
      2. Hill et al. (2016) investigated the environment in which leadership unfolds in the workplace, in politics, and in the education sector and identified key issues for creating lasting change. For example, they affirm that “Women’s representation in leadership will not increase substantially without major changes in the culture, policies, and practices of the organizations where women learn and work.” 
      3. Abendroth et al. (2017) explored how gender access to power is associated with gender differences in earnings. They further talked about women in power and gender inequalities. They found that giving women access to power may reduce gender stereotyping and establish an equilibrium to the gender earning gaps. 
      4. Rey (2005) talked about current perspectives on gender and leadership, emphasizing the case of women and providing explanations regarding the gender differences in leadership.  

29. Return to Your Original Objectives and Key Questions. 
    * **Key Questions**: Revisit your initial objectives and key questions to ensure that your research findings adequately address them. Reflect on whether your findings have effectively contributed to solving the identified problem.

    * **My Response**: Regarding the four sources that I highlighted above, they all address my initial objectives and key questions and effectively contribute to solving the problem of the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. 

### Part 3: Research Summary 
30. My Research Summary 
 
The issue of gender disparity in leadership has been a subject of academic scrutiny for decades. Rey (2005) discussed the broad implications of gender and leadership, emphasizing that empowering women in leadership roles is critical for achieving gender equity and driving societal progress. The author highlighted the intersectionality of gender with other social categories, such as race and class, noting how these intersections further complicate the leadership landscape for women.  
 
Hill et al. (2016) continued this exploration by providing a comprehensive overview of the barriers and biases that women encounter on their path to leadership. Their report from the American Association of University Women (AAUW) identified several key obstacles, including gender stereotypes, lack of mentoring, and organizational cultures that do not support women's leadership. They call for a multifaceted approach to address these challenges, including policy changes, organizational reforms, and cultural shifts that value diversity and inclusion.  
 
Building on this foundation, Abendroth et al. (2017) delved into the specific issue of the gender earnings gap and women's access to power within organizations. Their study highlighted that while women have made substantial progress in entering various professional fields, their advancement to leadership positions remains limited. The research further identified structural and institutional barriers that contribute to the gender earnings gap, suggesting that more equitable access to leadership roles for women could help mitigate these disparities and promote gender equity in the workplace.  
 
A recent perspective by Aina (2022) focused on the dynamics of women in leadership roles and the importance of creating supportive environments that facilitate women's advancement. The author pointed out that women leaders often face unique challenges, such as balancing professional and personal responsibilities, navigating organizational politics, and overcoming biases. She argued for the implementation of policies that promote work-life balance, mentorship programs, and leadership training tailored specifically to women. These policies will enhance women's representation in leadership, close the gender earnings gap, and benefit from the diverse perspectives and skills that women bring to leadership roles.
