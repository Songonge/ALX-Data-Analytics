## Daily 3
The Daily 3 is made of three things: Morning Pages, Movement, and Meditation.  
* **Morning Pages** was made famous more than 25 years ago in the best-selling book The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. Doing morning pages every day has been shown to increase creativity, positive mood, and big-picture thinking for all kinds of people. The point of Morning Pages is NOT what you write in them to be creative. Rather, it provides you the opportunity to clear out space in your head, so that your mind is more open to receive inspiration.
Here are the rules of how Morning Pages work:
  * If you can do them first thing when you wake up, that's the best. But any time of day is ok.
  * Just get a pen and paper and start writing! (Or keep a Morning Pages journal). You must do this by hand - don't type!
  * Write whatever pops into your head! Really, whatever's there. Just write it!
  * Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
  * If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!
  * Write 3 pages.
  * When you're done, put them in an envelope (or burn them)! Don’t re-read them. Don’t share them with anyone.
  * Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the process and not the product.
* **Movement**: There are many benefits of regular exercise. Not just limited to your physical health, exercise improves your mood, productivity, and your creativity as well. Move your body in some way every day, preferably for at least 20 minutes. Walking is just fine! Or pick any activity that you like! If you find it's something you enjoy, you'll be more likely to do it!
* **Meditation**: “Meditation makes the entire nervous system go into a field of coherence.” In the past two decades, research has shown mindfulness meditation's benefits:
  * improved concentration
  * greater calmness
  * increased self-awareness 

## Empathy
Empathy can be defined as an active attempt to understand another person's perspective and their emotions. It is our ability to communicate and understand each other’s emotional states, which is key to maintaining our relationships with others. 

The four qualities of empathy are:
1. Perspective taking: Ability to take the perspective of another person.
2. Staying out of judgment
3. Recognizing emotion in other people
4. Communicating emotion

## Global Challenges and Global Opportunities

## Emotional Intelligence
The theory of emotional intelligence can be broken down into four aspects which can help us make informed decisions, predict life outcomes, and build relationships.
*	The ability to perceive others’ emotions: for example, knowing if the other person is feeling overwhelmed so that you can adapt your communication accordingly.
*	Understanding others’ emotions and their associated patterns: for example, knowing when a potential client might be most likely to accept an offer you make.
*	Facilitating emotions: Using emotions to facilitate your thoughts: for example, knowing when you’re feeling anxious or nervous so that you don’t let it affect your judgment going into an interview.
*	Managing your own emotions: for example, the ability to manage disappointment, so that you can continue to make progress and not be discouraged by one failure.

### Personality Type
Six months ago, I took a test from a Professional Development course I found that my personality type was ISFJ: Introvert, Sensing, Feeling, and Judging.  
For this ALX program, I found that my personality type is ENTJ-A: Extrovert (60), Intuitive (57), Thinking (56), and Judging (97) – Assertive.  
Based on the two tests, I would say that I am a bivalent person (Introvert and Extrovert).  

### Knowing Yourself
A tool you can use here to help determine what you like and are good at is called “P.I.C.S.” – Passions, Interests, Causes, and Strengths.
*	Passions: What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasn’t an issue?
*	Interests: What are you most curious about?
*	Causes: What keeps you up at night?
*	Strengths: What are your superhero powers?

## Growth Mindset and Grit

### Growth Mindset
One of the biggest tools for our success is our **mindset**. It is important to know why and how we can change our thinking to achieve a healthy perspective and set of beliefs that will benefit us tremendously in our careers and lives.  
There is also power in being able to **control your mind and emotions in response to situations**. This is the key to being able to make rational decisions that are in your best interests.
|       Fixed Mindset     |    Growth Mindset |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | 
| Intelligence is static   |   Intelligence is developed       | 
| Avoid challenges  |  Embrace challenges | 
| It is too hard   |  I can train my brain   |
| Expect reward without effort  |  Effort is path to mastery  |
| Ignore feedback | Learn from feedback  |
| Threathened by the success of others | Inspired by the success of others |

### Grit
Grit is the passion and tenacity towards long-term, worthwhile goals. It is the capacity to stick with something and persevere in facing challenges. It propels performance and success independent of and beyond the contributions that ability and intelligence make.

## Self-Regulation and Self-Improvement

### Self-Regulation
“Self-regulation is the ability to monitor and control our own behavior, emotions, or thoughts, altering them in accordance with the demands of the situation.” - Education.com
A simple method by which we can manage any strong or overwhelming emotions is called the “RULER” Method. This method relies on us as individuals becoming curious about our emotions instead of being victims of them. “RULER” stands for:
*	Recognize: What is your current state at the moment?
*	Understand: What triggered this? Why might I be feeling this way?
*	Label: What would you call this feeling you are experiencing?
*	Express: How would you explain what just happened to someone else to ask for help or simply to share?
*	Regulate: What might you be able to do to help you manage this feeling/emotion?

### Self-Improvement
"Self-improvement is the act or process of improving oneself by one's own actions" - Merriam-Webster  
To practice self-improvement, you could:
* Block out the times of the day that you would like to do specific tasks.
* Create a habit tracker for yourself (for example on Excel) that will allow you to check box the key tasks that you want to make sure you accomplish every day. [Here is a habit tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q2u-R6ty3M3trOGgwIUR6S54-uZul5V0oyzqJxhY6zk/copy) that you can customize to your liking.

## Time Management
Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between activities. The goal is to optimize your time, so you can get the most important things done most effectively.
Managing your time will help you to:
1. Allocate adequate time 
2. Decide on the order of completion of your most important and urgent tasks.

There are many ways to manage time such as:
* Timetables
* Jotted notes
* To-do lists
* Google Tasks
* Prioritization tool known as The Eisenhower Matrix.

### prioritization
Merriam-Webster defines prioritization as “to organize [things] so that the most important thing is done or dealt with first.”  
The Eisenhower Matrix is also referred to as the Prioritization Matrix.  

Prioritization frameworks used by Technology teams: **MoSCoW**
*	**M = Must-Have**: Features that are absolutely essential for the project or product. They are critical, non-negotiable, and cannot be compromised. 
*	**S = Should-Have**: Features that are important but not as critical as the “must-have” ones. The new feature, requested by customers for interactive project data visualization, falls into this category. 
*	**C = Could-Have**: Nice-to-have features that are not critical for the project’s core functionality. In this scenario, there’s no direct mention of “could-have” features, but it’s a category to consider for lower-priority items.
*	**W = Won’t-Have**: Features that will not be worked on for the current version or iteration of the product. They are intentionally deprioritized.

Another commonly used prioritization model or framework used by tech teams is known as the **RICE model**. RICE stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. The RICE score is calculated based on the following formula
`RICE score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort`
